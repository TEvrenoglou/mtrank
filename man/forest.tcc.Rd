\title{Vizualize the study-specific preferences or ties generated from the treatment choice criterion defined by the function \code{\link{tcc}}.}
\usage{
\method{forest}{tcc}(x, treat = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "mtrank" generated as the output of the \code{\link{tcc}} function.}

\item{treat}{A treatment of interest. If specified it returns a forest plot for all study specific effects
related to \code{treat}. If NULL (default) it generated forest plots for all study-specific effects in the network.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
A forest plot that shows the study-specific treatment effects and the range of equivalence defined from the function \code{\link{tcc}}. Coloured
with red are the treatment effects which according to the \code{\link{tcc}} function were producing a treatment preference and coloured with
black those treatment effects producing a treatment tie.
}
\description{
This function produces a forest plot for all (or some specific) study specific comparisons and vizualizes the treatment preference or ties
which are defined from the treatment choice criterion which is constructed from the function \code{\link{tcc}}.
}
\details{
This function produces forest plots for the study specific treatment effects in the network. The legend of these graphs specifies whic
treatment effects were identified as treatment preferences and which as treatment ties. Additionally, the respective range of equivalence
defined at the function \code{\link{tcc}} is also vizualized for each forest plot. The argument \code{treat} is optional. If specified 
it returns only the forest plots in terms of the study-specific treatment effects related to the specified \code{treat}. If NULL it will 
return the forest plots in terms of all study-specific treatment effects in the network. We recommend that the specification of the argument 
\code{treat} especially for busy networks which contain many direct comparisons.
