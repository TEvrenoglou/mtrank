\usage{
\method{forest}{tcc}(
  x,
  treat = NULL,
  backtransf = FALSE,

\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{tcc}}.}

\item{treat}{A treatment of interest. If specified it returns a forest plot
for all study specific effects related to \code{treat}. If NULL (default),
it generates a forest plot for all study-specific effects in the network.}

\item{backtransf}{A logical indicating whether results should be
back transformed. If \code{backtransf = TRUE} (default), results for
\code{sm = "OR"} are printed as odds ratios rather than log odds ratios,
for example.}

\item{leftcols}{A character vector specifying columns
to be printed on the left side of the forest plot
(see \code{\link[meta]{forest.meta}}).}

\item{leftlabs}{A character vector specifying labels for
columns on left side of the forest plot.}

\item{rightcols}{A character vector specifying columns
to be printed on the right side of the forest plot
(see \code{\link[meta]{forest.meta}}).}

\item{lty.equi}{Line type (limits of equivalence).}

\item{col.equi}{Line colour (limits of equivalence).}

\item{fill.equi}{Colour(s) for area between limits of equivalence
or more general limits.}

\item{fill.lower.equi}{Colour of area between lower limit(s) and
reference value. Can be equal to the number of lower limits or
the number of limits plus 1 (in this case the the region between
minimum and smallest limit is also filled).}

\item{fill.upper.equi}{Colour of area between reference value and
upper limit(s). Can be equal to the number of upper limits or the
number of limits plus 1 (in this case the region between largest
limit and maximum is also filled).}

\item{header.line}{A logical value indicating whether to print a
header line or a character string ("both", "below", "").}

\item{col.subgroup}{The colour to print information on subgroups, i.e.,
pairwise comparisons.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments (passed on to
\code{\link[meta]{forest.meta}}).}
}
\value{
A forest plot is plotted in the active graphics device.

\description{
This function produces a forest plot for all (or selected) study
specific comparisons and visualizes the treatment preference or ties
which are defined from the treatment choice criterion in \code{\link{tcc}}.
}
\details{
This function produces forest plots for the study specific treatment effects
in the network. The color indicates whether treatment effects show
a preference (red color) or tie (black color). Additionally, the respective
range of equivalence defined at the function
\code{\link{tcc}} is visualized for the forest plot.

Argument \code{treat} is optional. By default ( \code{treat = NULL}),
all study-specific treatment effects in the network are shown. If specified,
only study-specific treatment effects related to the specified \code{treat}
are shown which is useful in busy networks with many direct comparisons.
