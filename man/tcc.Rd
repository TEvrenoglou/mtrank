\arguments{
\item{treat}{A list or vector with treatment information for
individual treatment arms (see Details).}

\item{event}{A list or vector with information on number of events
for individual treatment arms (see Details).}

\item{n}{A list or vector with information on number of
observations for individual treatment arms (see Details).}

\item{mean}{A list vector with estimated means for individual
treatment arms (see Details).}

\item{sd}{A list or vector with information on the standard
deviation for individual treatment arms (see Details).}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the study information.}

\item{studlab}{A vector with study labels.}

\item{mcid}{A numeric vector specifying the minimal clinically important
value (see Details).}

\item{lower.equi}{A numeric value specifying the lower limit of the range of
equivalence (see Details).}

\item{upper.equi}{A numeric value specifying the upper limit of the range of
equivalence (see Details).}

\item{small.values}{A character string specifying whether small 
treatment effects indicate a beneficial (\code{"desirable"}) or
harmful (\code{"undesirable"}) effect.}

\item{relax}{A logical optional argument. If TRUE it 'relaxes' the tcc 
to only consider the bounds of ROE when specifying 'wins' and ties. 
The default FALSE uses the criterion described by Evrenoglou et al. (2024)
and considers also the statistical significance on top of the ROE bounds
(see Details).}

\item{level}{The level used to calculate confidence intervals for
log-abilities.}

\item{sm}{The effect measure of interest (see Details).}

\item{keepdata}{A logical indicating whether original data should be kept in
tcc object.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments (passed on to
\code{\link[meta]{pairwise}}).}

\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{tcc}}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item The initial data in a paired-preference format.
\item The correspondence between the initial study names
  (passed in the argument studlab) and the index name of the
  paired-preference format data.

\description{
This function transforms data that are given in wide or long
arm-based format (e.g. input format for WinBUGS or JAGS) to a
paired-preference format needed as input to \code{\link{mtrank}}.
The function can transform data with binary and continuous arm-based to
preference-based format.
}
\details{
R function \code{\link{mtrank}} expects data in a \bold{paired-preference}
format, where for each study-specific pairwise comparison in the network a
treatment preference or tie is indicated. For example, for the
study-specific comparison between treatments \emph{A} and \emph{B} the
potential outcomes are:
\itemize{
\item \emph{A} > \emph{B}
\item \emph{A} < \emph{B}
\item \emph{A} = \emph{B}
}

The data transformation takes place based on the study-specific treatment
effects and the treatment choice criterion. R function
\code{\link[meta]{pairwise}} is called internally to calculate the
study-specific treatment effect estimates and standard errors. This ensures
that data given in either 'long' or 'wide' arm-based format will be suitably
used to calculate the study-specific treatment effect estimates and standard
errors while ensuring that a network of multi-arm studies gets an
equivalent representation as a network of two-arm studies.

This function implements treatment choice criteria based on the method
by Evrenoglou et al. (2024). Namely, a range of equivalence (ROE) can be
specified by
\itemize{
\item argument \code{mcid}. Then the limits of the ROE
  will be defined based on the values (i) \code{mcid}, \code{1/mcid} for
  ratio measures and (ii) \code{mcid} and \code{-mcid} for difference
  measures.
\item arguments \code{lower.equi} and \code{upper.equi}.
  These arguments allow the users to define their own limits of the ROE,
  given the restriction that the lower limit will always be smaller than the
  upper limit.
}

Note that when the argument \code{mcid} is specified, the arguments
\code{lower.equi} and \code{upper.equi} are ignored.
Either only the \code{mcid} or both of the \code{lower.equi} and
\code{upper.equi} must be specified for the proper
definition of the ROE.

After setting the ROE, each study-specific treatment effect will be
categorised as a treatment preference or a tie. The argument \code{relax}
controls the amount of conservatism of the treatment choice criterion.
If set to \code{FALSE} (default), the treatment choice criterion is
equivalent to the one described by Evrenoglou et al. (2024). In this case,
study-specific treatment effects need to be both statistically and clinically
significant to indicate a treatment preference. If set to \code{TRUE}, the
criterion is relaxed and the study-specific treatment effects need to be only
clinically significant to indicate a treatment preference. 

This function can transform data with binary and continuous outcomes.
Depending on the outcome, the following arguments are mandatory:
\itemize{
\item treat, event, n (for binary outcomes);
\item treat, n, mean, sd (for continuous outcomes).
}

Finally, the argument \code{sm} is used to define the effect measure of
interest for transforming the data into paired-preference format;
see \code{\link{metabin}} and \code{\link{metacont}} for a list of available
effect measures.
