for individual treatment arms (see Details).}

observations for individual treatment arms (see Details).}

treatment arms (see Details).}

deviation for individual treatment arms (see Details).}

\item{studlab}{A vector with study labels.}

\item{mcid}{A numeric vector specifying the minimal clinically important value (see Details).}

\item{l.roe}{A numeric value specifying the lower limit of the range of equivalence (see Details).}

\item{u.roe}{A numeric value specifying the upper limit of the range of equivalence (see Details).}

\item{small.values}{A character string specifying whether small 
treatment effects indicate a beneficial (\code{"desirable"}) or
harmful (\code{"undesirable"}) effect.}

\item{relax}{A logical optional argument. If TRUE it 'relaxes' the tcc 
to only consider the bounds of ROE when specifying 'wins' and ties. 
The default FALSE uses the criterion described by Evrenoglou et al. and considers
also the statistical significance on top of the ROE bounds (see Details).}

\description{
This function transforms data that are given in wide or long
arm-based format (e.g. input format for WinBUGS or JAGS) to a
paired-preference format that is needed as input to R function
\code{\link{mtrank}}. The function can transform data with binary and
continuous arm-based to preference-based format.
}
\details{
R function \code{\link{mtrank}} expects data in a
\bold{paired-preference format}, where for each study-specific pairwise comparison in the network
a treatment preference or a treatment tie is indicated. For example, for the study-specific comparison
between treatments \emph{A} and \emph{B} the potential outcomes are: (i) \emph{A}>\emph{B}
(ii) \emph{B}>\emph{A} or (iii) \emph{A}=\emph{B}. 

The data transformation takes place based on 
the study-specific treatment effects and the treatment choice criterion. To calculate the study-specific
treatment effect estimates and standard errors the tcc function uses the \code{\link{pairwise}} function which is available from the
R package netmeta. This ensures that data given in either 'long' or 'wide' arm-based format
will be suitably used to calculate the study-specific treatment effect estimates and standard errors while
ensuring that a network of multi-arm studies gets and equivalent representation as a network of two-arm studies.

The tcc function includes treatment choice criteria based on the method by Evrenoglou et al.. This approach uses the range of equivalence (ROE) which through the \code{tcc} function can be defined in two different ways.

\itemize{
\item by specifying the argument \code{mcid}. Then the limits of the ROE
  will be defined based on the values (i) \code{mcid}, \code{1/mcid} for
  ratio measures and (ii) \code{mcid} and \code{-mcid} for difference
  measures.
\item by specifying the arguments \code{l.roe} and \code{u.roe}.
  These arguments allow the users to define their own limits of the ROE,
  given the restriction that the lower limit will always be smaller than the
  upper limit.
}

Note that when the argument \code{mcid} is specified, the arguments \code{l.roe} and \code{u.roe} are deprecated. 
Either only the \code{mcid} or both of the \code{l.roe} and \code{u.roe} should be specified mandatorily specified for the proper
definition of the ROE.

After setting the ROE the tcc function uses it to specify whether each of the study-specific treatment effects refers to a 
treatment preference or a tie. The argument \code{relax} controls the amount of conservatism of the treatment choice criterion
If set as FALSE (default) then the treatment choice criterion is equivalent to the one described by Evrenoglou et al., 2024. 
In this case the study-specific treatment effect need to be both statistically and clinically significant to indicate a treatment preference. If set to TRUE
the criterion is relaxed and the study-specific treatment effects need to be only clinically significant to indicate a treatment preference. 

The tcc function can transform data with binary and continuous outcomes.
'Depending on the outcome, the following arguments are mandatory:
\itemize{
\item treat, event, n (for binary outcomes);
\item treat, n, mean, sd (for continuous outcomes);
}

Finally, the argument \code{sm} is used to define the effect measure of interest for transforming the data into paired-preference format.
For binary outcomes the available effect measures are: (i) Odds ratio (sm="OR"), (ii) Risk ratio (sm="RR") and Risk difference (sm="RD").
For continuous outcomes the available effect measures are: (i) Mean Difference (sm="MD") and Standardized mean difference (sm="SMD").
