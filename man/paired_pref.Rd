\title{Calculate pairwise probabilities for \code{\link{mtrank}} object}
\usage{
paired_pref(x, treat1, treat2, type)

\method{print}{paired_pref}(x, type = attr(x, "type"), digits = 4, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{mtrank}}.}

\item{treat1}{The first treatment considered in the treatment comparison.}

\item{treat2}{The second treatment considered in the treatment comparison.}

\item{type}{A character vector specifying the probability of interest.
Either "better", "tie", "worse", or "all" (can be abbreviated).}

\item{digits}{Minimal number of significant digits for proportions,
see \code{print.default}.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments (passed on to \code{\link{prmatrix}}).}
}
\value{
The probability (or probabilities) of interest for the comparison
\code{treat1} vs \code{treat2} based on the argument \code{type}.
}
\description{
This function uses the estimates of ability and tie prevalence parameters
from a \code{\link{mtrank}} object and calculates pairwise probabilities
about the preference or the tie between two treatments based on equations (7)
and (8) in Evrenoglou et al. (2024).
}
\details{
Pairwise probabilities between any two treatments in the network can be
calculated using the ability estimates obtained from \code{\link{mtrank}}
and equations (7) and (8) in Evrenoglou et al. (2024). The probabilities
are calculated in the direction \code{treat1} vs \code{treat2}. The available
probability types are
\itemize{
\item "better": probability that \code{treat1} is better than \code{treat2},
\item "tie": probability that \code{treat1} is equal to \code{treat2},
\item "worse": probability that \code{treat1} is worse than \code{treat2},
\item "all": all three probabilities.
}

Please note that all the arguments of this function are mandatory.
