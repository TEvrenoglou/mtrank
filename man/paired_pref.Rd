\title{Calculate pairwise probabilities using the output of the \code{\link{mtrank}} function.}
\usage{
paired_pref(x, treat1, treat2, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "mtrank".}

\item{treat1}{The first treatment considered in the treatment comparison.}

\item{treat2}{The second treatment considered in the treatment comparison.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the probability of interest.
Either "better", "tie", "worse", or "all" (can be abbreviated).}
}
\value{
The probability (or probabilities) of interest for the comparison \code{treat1} vs \code{treat2} based on the argument \code{type}.
}
\description{
This function uses the estimates of the ability and tie prevalence parameters obtained by the \code{\link{mtrank}} function
and calculates pairwise probabilities about the preference or the tie between two treatments based on Equations 7 and 8 
from the manuscript by Evrenoglou et al.
}
\details{
Pairwise probabilities between any two treatments in the network can be calculated using the ability estimates
obtained from the \code{\link{mtrank}} function and the Equations 7 and 8 from Evrenoglou et al. The probabilities
are calculated in the direction \code{treat1} vs \code{treat2}. The available probability types are
\itemize{
\item "better": Calculates the probability that \code{treat1} is better than \code{treat2}.
\item "tie": Calculates the probability that \code{treat1} is equal to \code{treat2}.
\item "worse": Calculates the probability that \code{treat1} is worse than \code{treat2}.
\item "all": Calculates all the previous probabilities simultaneously.
}

Please note that all the arguments of this function are mandatory.
