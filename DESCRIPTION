Description: Implementation of a novel frequentist approach to produce clinically relevant treatment hierarchies in network meta-analysis. The method is based on treatment choice criteria (TCC) and probabilistic ranking models, as described by Evrenoglou et al. (2024) <DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2406.10612>. The TCC are defined using a rule based on the minimal clinically important difference. Using the defined TCC, the study-level data (i.e., treatment effects and standard errors) are first transformed into a preference format, indicating either a treatment preference (e.g., treatment A > treatment B) or a tie (treatment A = treatment B). The preference data are then synthesized using a probabilistic ranking model, which estimates the latent ability parameter of each treatment and produces the final treatment hierarchy. This parameter represents each treatmentâ€™s ability to outperform all the other competing treatments in the network. Consequently, larger ability estimates indicate higher positions in the ranking list.
