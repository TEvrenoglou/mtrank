#' Calculate pairwise probabilities using the output of the \code{\link{mtrank}} function.
#' 
#' @description
#' This function uses the estimates of the ability and tie prevalence parameters obtained by the \code{\link{mtrank}} function
#' and calculates pairwise probabilities about the preference or the tie between two treatments based on Equations 7 and 8 
#' from the manuscript by Evrenoglou et al.
#
#' @param x An object of class "mtrank".
#' @param treat1 The first treatment considered in the treatment comparison.
#' @param treat2 The second treatment considered in the treatment comparison.
#' @param type A character string specifying the probability of interest.
#'   Either "better", "tie", "worse", or "all" (can be abbreviated).
#'
#' @details  
#' Pairwise probabilities between any two treatments in the network can be calculated using the ability estimates
#' obtained from the \code{\link{mtrank}} function and the Equations 7 and 8 from Evrenoglou et al. The probabilities
#' are calculated in the direction \code{treat1} vs \code{treat2}. The available probability types are
#' \itemize{
#' \item "better": Calculates the probability that \code{treat1} is better than \code{treat2}.
#' \item "tie": Calculates the probability that \code{treat1} is equal to \code{treat2}.
#' \item "worse": Calculates the probability that \code{treat1} is worse than \code{treat2}.
#' \item "all": Calculates all the previous probabilities simultaneously.
#' }
#' 
#' Please note that all the arguments of this function are mandatory.
#' 
#' @return
#' The probability (or probabilities) of interest for the comparison \code{treat1} vs \code{treat2} based on the argument \code{type}.
