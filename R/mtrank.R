#' Estimate the treatment hierarchy in network meta-analysis using probabilistic ranking models.
#' 
#' @description
#' This function fits the Bradley-Terry ranking model and produces a treatment hierarchy based
#' on the method described by Evrenoglou et al. for network meta-analysis. 
#' 
#' @param x The output of the function \code{\link{tcc}}.
#' @param reference.group An argument specifying the reference group. If set to NULL (default)
#' the output of the mtrank function will contain the ability estimates of all treatments. If 
#' some treatment is set a the reference group then the output of the mtrank function will contain the 
#' relative abilities of all treatments versus the specified reference treatment.
#'   
#' @details
#' This function is used to fit a Bradley-Terry model to the paired-preference data generated from the treatment choice criterion 
#' constructed by the \code{\link{tcc}} function. The mtrank() function estimates the ability of each treatment in the network and the respective
#' standard errors and confidence intervals using the maximum likelihood approach. To retain identifiability the maximization of the log-likelihood
#' takes place subject to the constrain that the ability estimates sum to 1. Then, based on iterative processes the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs)
#' are calculated. Note that the final estimates of the ability parameters are not necessarily needed to sum to 1 as after the first iteration of the algorithm
#' the ability estimates are not normalized. However, by normalizing the final ability estimates to sum up to 1 these can be interpreted as "the probability that
#' each treatment is having the highest ability". Finally, a parameter "v" controlling the prevalence of ties in the network is also estimated through
#' the mtrank() function. Although the estimated values of this parameter does not have a direct interpretation it is useful for estimating pairwise 
#' probabilities using the \code{\link{paired_pref}} function. 
#' 
#' If the argument \code{ref} is not NULL then a reference treatment group is specified according to this treatment. Mathematically, this means
#' that the maximization problem is now identifiable subject to the condition that the ability of this treatment is 0. Then the resulting MLEs
#' are the relative abilities of all treatments in the network versus the specified reference treatment group. Note that the estimates of the 
#' parameter "v" and the normalized probabilities do not depend on the definition or not of a reference treatment group. 
#' 
#' @return
#' \itemize{
#' \item A data frame containing the resulting log-ability estimates, their standard errors and their confidence intervals.
#' \item The estimate of the parameter tie prevalence parameter v.
#' \item The normalized ability estimates for each treatment.
